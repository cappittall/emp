# Embroidery Patch Cutter Workflow (Pre-Cutting Stages)

This workflow streamlines the process of selecting, tracking, and preparing embroidery patches for cutting. By saving reusable masks and providing live detection feedback, this solution enhances efficiency and accuracy.
Here's a clear breakdown of the optimized patch detection process:

## Template Creation Phase
- User selects single patch via drag-drop
- System captures:
  - Background color from top-left starting point
  - Patch dimensions (width, height)
  - Patch contour shape
  - Edge characteristics
  - Color transition profile

## Background Analysis
- Sample top-left pixel colors
- Create color threshold ranges
- Define background mask parameters
- Establish contrast boundaries

## Patch Detection Pipeline
- Apply background color masking
- Extract potential patch regions
- Filter regions by template size
- Match shapes against template
- Validate patch characteristics

## Border Processing
- Extract contours of matched patches
- Generate ordered cutting points
- Optimize cutting path
- Create G-code or machine instructions

## Quality Control
- Verify patch dimensions
- Check edge quality
- Validate cutting points
- Ensure proper spacing

## Output Generation
- Create cutting coordinates
- Generate path visualization
- Prepare machine instructions
- Save pattern data

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initial Mask Creation

1. **Load Image**  
   - Click the "Load Image" button and select the reference patch image.

2. **Generate Mask**  
   - SAM2 automatically detects and generates multiple mask options from the image.

3. **Save Mask**  
   - Save each mask to the library at `data/masks/...`.
   - Each saved mask includes:
     - The **original image**
     - **Mask data** in JSON format
     - A **thumbnail preview**

---

### 2. Mask Library Usage

- **Thumbnail Display**  
  - Thumbnails of saved masks are shown in a 200x200 window.

- **Select Mask**  
  - Click on any thumbnail to load the mask into memory for use.

---

### 3. Live Detection

- **Camera Feed**  
  - A continuous live feed displays the workspace.

- **Mask Tracking**  
  - The selected mask tracks in real-time on the camera feed.
  
- **Overlay and Status**  
  - An overlay shows the position of detected patches, with a status update on detection confidence.

---

### 4. Cutting Preparation  (Later will implement)

1. **Verify Alignment**  
   - Ensure that the detected patch aligns with the desired position on the camera feed.

2. **Confirm Patch Position**  
   - Double-check the patch position before proceeding.

3. **Activate Cutting Mode**  
   - Once confirmed, the "Start Cutting" button becomes active, indicating readiness for the cutting process.

This workflow optimizes the embroidery patch cutting process by saving masks for quick access and providing clear visual feedback at every step.

## Suggested Enhancements

1. **Status Notifications**  
   - Display real-time status updates during mask detection (e.g., "High Confidence" or "Low Confidence") to minimize errors in patch positioning.

2. **Error Handling**  
   - Implement alerts for common issues, such as:
     - **Mask Misalignment**: Notification if the mask doesn’t align with the patch.
     - **Patch Out of Frame**: Warning when the patch moves outside the camera’s view.

3. **Guided Setup**  
   - Add an initial calibration step to align the camera view with the workspace, ensuring accurate mask tracking across sessions and improving consistency.

These enhancements could improve usability and ensure higher precision, especially for non-technical operators.



I want to load the original.png image on 2. Detected Masks place. And place the masks on image .
- all masks should be clicable in order to select ( selected mask should be hightligt or any proper sign) 
- After selections done, we should combine all selected masks and make a single ( conconated masks) and need to find the borders of this masks in order to cut around. ( parallel to the main aim above explained) 
- Or
